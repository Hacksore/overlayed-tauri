So you want to be abe to see your Discord voice chat while playing Minecraft? Here's how you can do it using Overlayed since the native Discord overlay does not support Minecraft.

### Preqrequisites for Windows / Linux
- Launcher such as [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com)
- Mod loader like [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge) or [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net)

### Setup
Grab the latest version of [Overlayed](/) for your platform from the website.

#### Windows / Linux

Now since Minecraft does not support the native [Borderless Windowed Mode](/blog/discord-overlay-in-any-game) you will need to install a mod to get Overlayed working. 
- [Borderless Mining](https://modrinth.com/mod/borderless-mining) 
- [Cubes Without Borders](https://modrinth.com/mod/cubes-without-borders)

#### macOS
It requires no mods or custom launchers as Overlayed should show up in a fullscreen application.

### Usage

Now you can launch Discord and Overlayed. Make sure to join a voice chat and pin Overlayed where you'd like.

<div
  class="bg-yellow-900 border border-yellow-500 text-white px-4"
  role="alert"
>
  <p class="font-bold h-3">Windows and Linux Users</p>
  <p class="text-sm">
    If you are using a borderless mod please follow the mods install and usage instructions to enable borderless mode.
  </p>
</div>

Happy Mining ðŸ’Ž
