# About Overlayed

## üòÖ What is Overlayed
Overlayed gives you a movable overlay for Discord voice chat. This means you can be playing your favorite game like Minecraft and still see who is talking.

It's not limited to only games either. You can use Overlayed for any occasions like surfing the web or when you're deep in a coding session.

## ü§î Why does Overlayed exist

Overlayed was created because there is not an official "out of game" overlay for Discord. I created Overlayed to be able to see the voice chat for occasions other than gaming or if you are on a platform that doesn't support the native overlay.

## üìî Backstory on the [Official Discord Game Overlay](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/217659737-Game-Overlay-101)

The way the Official game overlay works is very similar to how game hacking works. It will find the process that it wants to inject a browser rendering engine.

Keep in mind the Discord overlay only works on Windows so if you are on Linux or Mac there is no support for you. Also, the game overlay requires Discord themselves to reverse engineer every game which is why they have a limited list of supported games.

## üîç How does Overlayed work

**tl;dr** the Discord client exposes a websocket on port range `6463-6472` and Overlayed uses the [Discord RPC API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rpc) to interface with the desktop and receive events.

## ü¶∫ Is Overlayed safe to use

Yes, Overlayed is a registered Discord app (`905987126099836938`)!
